# Project-404
Project 404 is a WIP Pikmin fangame, developed in Unity.

Project 404 was originally worked on as a Pikmin 1 HD remake,
however it has since developed into something more of a fully
fledged Pikmin fan project.

It is currently being worked on by members of the Pikmin
community including musicians, programmers, and others
wanting to help out where they can.
