# Project 404

Forked in case I ever develop motivation and to save the game should it be deleted

Project 404 was a fangame being developed by a team of fans of Pikmin.
I have left the project to move onto other projects, and a lack of motivation.
If anyone can fork and continue the work that'd be great.
